### How this documentation is structured

Within this folder, you will find documentation regarding the use of the API.

This documentation is structured in the way the API is, as such, `users/` contains information about the `/users` endpoint(s).

Where you see content in curly brackets, that means that, that content, is to be replaced by you during API interaction, what we'd call a variable, or identifier.

Documentation contains the `curl` command used to negotiate with the endpoint, and possible responses.

The response section only contains a successful response, while errors can be found under the errors section.
